1. Go to **Users**.  
2. Find the **Application User** that is linked to your existing *Entra App* (used for nemEDI's API access).  
3. Open the user and add the following permission set:  
   âœ… **nemEDI CORE â€“ Reopen Sales Orders**  
   (This permission set is automatically included with the module.)

The module adds a secure API endpoint in your Business Central that nemEDI's system can call to automatically reopen sales orders.  
This happens using your existing OAuth token and with BC's own validation rules.
